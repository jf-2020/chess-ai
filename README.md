# Chess AI
- initial phase: simple chess AI + basic interface

---

### Goal 0: Scaffolding
- created project structure
- reflects that game + ai + interface are separate concerns

### Goal 1: Board + Game Session (State) & Agents
- created Board and Game objects to manage mechanics of board as well as state of a given game (because we intend to allow for live play, eventually)
- wrote Player and Agent scaffolding, since arbitrary players & agents (not just AI's) will be used
- added app-level data
